![Preview](./assets/screenshot_default.png)

## Installation

### Download Binary (Recommended)
Since `srwm` is built with most dependencies statically linked, you can run it on almost any Linux distribution.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/infraflakes/srwm/releases) page.
2. Make it executable and move it to your path:
   ```bash
   chmod +x srwm-v*-linux-amd64
   sudo mv srwm-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/srwm
   ```

### Getting started

> [!CAUTION]
> You should modify the font config at ~/.config/srwm/bar.lua
> And keybindings at ~/.config/srwm/keybindings.lua before starting
> The default tab bar uses nerd glyph to display control buttons, you may want to install it

You can generate the default config with `srwm kickstart`:

```bash
srwm kickstart
```

Then start the window manager with `srwm start` (make sure you have xorg-xauth utility installed):
```bash
srwm start
```

srwm by default only shrinks or expand windows to mimick zoom because it requires a compositor, for true zooming visuals you can use [srcom](https://github.com/infraflakes/srcom/releases/).

### Building from scratch

Current the project only supports building with [dagger](https://dagger.io/).
